\section*{Abstract}

{Every copy of the thesis must have an abstract. An abstract must provide a concise summary of the thesis. In style, the
abstract should be a miniature version of the thes0is: short introduction, a summary of the results, conclusions or main
arguments presented in the thesis. The abstract may not exceed 150 words for a Degree’s thesis.}
The recent boom of AI and the recent advancements in deep neural networks have (DNNs) a direct effect
on the increasing demmand of DNN accelerators targeting a specific or a set of models. However, designing an accelerator is not an
easy feat. There are different challenges. First, the amount of time required to create a DNN accelerator
based on an existing model. Second, these DNNs models have plenty of parameters, WIP to have into account
 Ironically, there is a boom of AI tools that can help in the design proccess of these
accelerators.
